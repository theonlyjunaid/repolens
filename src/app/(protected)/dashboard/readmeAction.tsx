# Deepfake Detector App üîé

## Project Overview

This project implements a Streamlit application that detects deepfakes in images and videos.  Users can upload their media, choose a detection model, and receive a prediction along with a probability score.  The app provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with sophisticated deepfake detection models.

## Project Features

- **Image and Video Deepfake Detection:** Analyze both image and video files for deepfake manipulation.
- **Model Selection:** Choose from different pre-trained deepfake detection models (EfficientNet variants).
- **Dataset Selection:** Specify the dataset the model was trained on (DFDC or FF++).
- **Threshold Adjustment:** Control the sensitivity of the detection by setting a probability threshold.
- **Interactive Interface:** User-friendly Streamlit interface for easy file uploads and interaction.
- **Clear Results:**  Displays "real" or "fake" prediction with associated probability, color-coded for clarity.

## Project Tech Stack

- **Streamlit:**  Framework for building interactive web apps for machine learning.
- **Pillow (PIL):** Image processing library for handling image uploads and manipulation.
- **PyTorch:** Deep learning framework for model loading and inference.
- **BlazeFace:**  Face detection model for extracting faces from images and videos.
- **EfficientNet (variants):**  Convolutional neural network architectures used for deepfake detection.
- **Xception:** Another CNN architecture option for deepfake detection.
- **NumPy:** Numerical computing library for array manipulation.
- **OpenCV (cv2):**  Computer vision library used for video processing.
- **SciPy:** Scientific computing library for mathematical functions.
- **Albumentations:**  Library for image augmentation (used during model training).
- **Pandas:** Data manipulation library for handling datasets.
- **Flask (for API):**  Web framework for creating a backend API (if applicable).

## Project Conclusion

This Deepfake Detector App offers a practical solution for identifying potential deepfakes in images and videos.  By leveraging powerful deep learning models and a user-friendly interface, it empowers users to assess the authenticity of digital media.  Future improvements could include adding more models, supporting different media formats, and integrating explainability features.
